    "    - To what extent does this submission utilize creative, cutting-edge, or innovative techniques? This can be demonstrated in any or all parts of the submission (e.g., preprocessing, embeddings, models, visualizations).\n",
    "- Communication (25%)\n",
    "    - To what extent are findings clearly and effectively communicated? This includes both text and visuals.\n",
    "- Rigor (20%)\n",
    "    - To what extent is this submission based on appropriate and correctly implemented methods and approaches (e.g., preprocessing, embeddings, models) with adequate sample sizes?\n",
    "- Insight (20%)\n",
    "    - To what extent does this submission contain useful insights about the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning methods at uncovering patterns in this data and/or informative findings that can advance the research on circumstances related to older adult falls?\n",

    "We know this is an open-ended challenge. To help, we are providing some guiding lines of inquiry to help you get started. Feel free to use these or try something completely different!\n",

    "- What information about falls is contained in the narrative but not captured by the other variables?  \n",
    "- What precipitating events — actions that happen right before the fall — can be identified?  \n",
    "- How do falls (e.g., severity, type of fall injury) and fall circumstances (e.g., precipitating event, activity involved) differ among various demographic groups (e.g., by race, sex, age)?  \n",
    "- Are there trends over time in the types of falls that occur?  \n",
    "- What kinds of people, places, or things are associated with more or more severe falls? Are there alternative explanations for these associations?\n",
    "- What risk factors are associated with falls?  \n",
    "- The goal of this challenge is to explore the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques to this dataset. Below are some examples of analysis that would be a good fit for this challenge, as well as examples of analysis that are not a good fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good fit\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove words from the narratives that are found in other variables (e.g., male, female, body parts) and cluster the remaining text to identify what information is in the narratives that is not captured elsewhere. Then use word embeddings to remove similar words and repeat the analysis.\n",
    "- Design a way to identify the \"precipitating event\" before a fall (e.g., tripping on carpet) and compare differences in precipitating events among various demographic groups.\n",
    "- Explore various clustering algorithms using the provided embeddings. Use the ChatGPT API to produce summaries of the clusters. Compare the results of using the embeddings versus using more traditional bag-of-words preprocessing techniques (e.g., stop word and punctuation removal, stemming and lemmatization, and token weighting such as TF-IDF).\n"

Her course has been very complicated since then with needing multiple surgeries for removal of hematoma.  This is partly because she was on anticoagulation for a right arm deep venous thrombosis (DVT) she had early this year, complicated by septic phlebitis.,Chart was reviewed, and I will not reiterate her complex history.\")"
